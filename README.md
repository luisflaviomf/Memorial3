# About This Project

- **Source**:
  - ASP.NET Core ([link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet));
  - Digital Memorials: Design Ratings and Recommendations ([link](https://sol.sbc.org.br/journals/index.php/jis/article/view/2567));

## **Prototypes:**
System prototype ([link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3658271.3658301)): Study with artifacts (Requirements, prototypes, and tests) created for the system and published at an international conference.

## **Context:**
[ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) is designed to allow rapid evolution of runtime components, APIs, compilers, and languages while providing a stable and supported platform to keep applications running.

[Digital Memorial](https://sol.sbc.org.br/journals/index.php/jis/article/view/2567) is an online platform dedicated to preserving and sharing memories, tributes, and information about individuals, events, or specific topics. Serving as a virtual space for reminiscence, a digital memorial can encompass a variety of media such as photos, videos, testimonials, and documents, providing a multifaceted representation of the person or subject in question. These platforms offer an interactive means for individuals to contribute their own memories, fostering meaningful and participatory connections in a digital environment designed to honor and preserve history.

[Collective Digital Memorial](https://sol.sbc.org.br/journals/index.php/jis/article/view/2567) When, in a digital memorial, the deceased individuals honored share a common bond. They may still be a dedicated or integrated memorial system. For example, the Memorial for COVID-19 Victims in Brazil is a collective digital memorial integrated with the social network Facebook, and relíquia.rum is integrated with Instagram. On the other hand, "Inumeráveis" (2020) is a dedicated collective digital memorial as it is presented on a website dedicated to the memorial.

## **Objectives:**
A collective digital memorial built with ASP.NET. The start of this initiative dates back to meticulously crafted prototypes during a comprehensive research period spanning from 2021 to 2022. Currently in active development, this project aims to transform these prototypes into a robust and user-friendly platform for collective remembrance, leveraging the powerful features offered by ASP.NET.

This digital memorial represents a dynamic evolution of the insights gained during the research phase, incorporating refinements in design and implementation of features to enhance the overall user experience. As a continuously evolving project, it serves as an exploration of ASP.NET's capabilities in creating meaningful and interactive web applications aimed at preserving and sharing memories.

By opening this repository, I invite collaboration, feedback, and contributions from the community. Together, we can shape and enhance this digital memorial project, contributing to the collective exploration of ASP.NET's potential in creating touching spaces for reflection and remembrance.
